Error: It looks like you are building ccache from a release archive. If so,
there is no need to run autoconf.sh. See INSTALL.md for further instructions.

If you do want to the enable the development mode, delete the file
dev_mode_disabled first, but it's probably a better idea to work with the
proper ccache Git repository directly as described on
<https://ccache.dev/repo.html>.
