ccache news
===========


ccache 3.2.notyetreleased
-------------------------
Release date: unknown


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for configuring ccache via one or several configuration files
  instead of via environment variables. Environment variables still have
  priority but are no longer the recommended way of customizing ccache
  behavior. See the manual for more information.

- Made creation of temporary directories and cache directories smarter to avoid
  unnecessary `stat()` calls.

- Various improvements and fixes on win32.

- Improved test suite.

- Added `--dump-manifest` command-line option for debugging purposes.

- Improved efficiency of the algorithm that scans for `__DATE_` and `__TIME__`
  tokens in the hashed source code.

- Upgraded bundled zlib to version 1.2.8.

- Added support for several binaries in `CCACHE_PREFIX` (separated by space).

- Compiler options `-fprofile-generate`, `-fprofile-arcs` and `-fprofile-use`
  are now handled without bailing.

- The displaying and interpretation of cache size has been changed to use SI
  units.

- Default cache size is now 5 GB (was previously 1 GiB).


[News added up to commit 757ffb19cb69f88db48f732eb8d3fc8eeb333e17.]


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The `-c` option is no longer passed to the preprocessor. This fixes problems
  with clang and Solaris's C++ compiler.


ccache 3.1.10
-------------
Release date: 2014-10-19


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for the `-Xclang` compiler option.

- Improved handling of exit code of internally executed processes.

- Zero length object files in the cache are now rejected as invalid.

- Bail out on option `-gsplit-dwarf` (since it produces multiple output files).

- Compiler option `-fdebug-prefix-map` is now ignored (not part of the hash).
  (The `-fdebug-prefix-map` option may be used in combination with
  `CCACHE_BASEDIR` to reuse results across different directories.)

- Added note in documentation that `--ccache-skip` currently does not mean
  ``don't hash the following option''.

- To enable support for precompiled headers (PCH), `CCACHE_SLOPPINESS` now also
  needs to include the new `pch_defines` sloppiness. This is because ccache
  can't detect changes in the source code when only defined macros have been
  changed.

- Stale files in the internal temporary directory (`<ccache_dir>/tmp`) are now
  cleaned up if they are older than one hour.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed path canonicalization in `make_relative_path()` when path doesn't
  exist.

- Fixed bug in `common_dir_prefix_length()`. This corrects the `CCACHE_BASEDIR`
  behavior.

- ccache no longer tries to create the cache directory when `CCACHE_DISABLE` is
  set.

- Fixed bug when reading manifests with a very large number of file info
  entries.

- Fixed problem with logging of current working directory.


ccache 3.1.9
------------
Release date: 2013-01-06


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The EAGAIN signal is now handled correctly when emitting cached stderr
  output. This fixes a problem triggered by large error outputs from the
  compiler.

- Subdirectories in the cache are no longer created in read-only mode.

- Fixed so that ccache's log file descriptor is not made available to the
  compiler.

- Improved error reporting when failing to create temporary stdout/stderr files
  when executing the compiler.

- Disappearing temporary stdout/stderr files are now handled gracefully.


Other
~~~~~

- Fixed test suite to work on ecryptfs.


ccache 3.1.8
------------
Release date: 2012-08-11


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made paths to dependency files relative in order to increase cache hits.

- Added work-around to make ccache work with buggy GCC 4.1 when creating a
  pre-compiled header.

- Clang plugins are now hashed to catch plugin upgrades.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed crash when the current working directory has been removed.

- Fixed crash when stderr is closed.

- Corrected a corner case when parsing backslash escapes in string
  literals.

- Paths are now correctly canonicalized when computing paths relative to the
  base directory.


Other
~~~~~

- Made git version macro work when compiling outside of the source directory.

- Fixed `static_assert` macro definition clash with GCC 4.7.


ccache 3.1.7
------------
Release date: 2012-01-08


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Non-writable `CCACHE_DIR` is now handled gracefully when `CCACHE_READONLY` is
  set.

- Made failure to create files (typically due to bad directory permissions) in
  the cache directory fatal. Previously, such failures were silently and
  erroneously flagged as "compiler produced stdout".

- Both the `-specs=file` and `--specs=file` forms are now recognized.

- Added recognition and hashing of GCC plugins specified with `-fplugin=file`.

- `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK` now also determines how to hash explicit specs files
  (`-specs=file`).

- Added `CPATH`, `C_INCLUDE_PATH` and similar environment variables to the hash
  to avoid false cache hits when such variables have changed.

- Corrected log message when unify mode is enabled.

- Reverted the GCC bug compatibility introduced in ccache 3.1.5 for `-MT`/`-MQ`
  options with concatenated arguments. (The bug is fixed in recent GCC
  versions.)


Other
~~~~~

- Corrected license header for `mdfour.c`.

- Improved documentation on how to fix bad object files in the cache.

  correctly when they are last on the command line.

- ccache is now bug compatible with GCC for the `-MT`/`-MQ` options with
  concatenated arguments.

- Fixed a minor memory leak.

- Systems that lack (and don't need to be linked with) libm are now supported.

  hits.

- ccache now copes with file systems that don't know about symbolic links.

- The file handle in now correctly closed on write error when trying to create
  a cache dir tag.


ccache 3.1.3
------------

- Made the ``too new header file'' test case work on file systems with
  unsynchronized clocks.

- The test suite now also works on systems that lack a /dev/zero.


ccache 3.1.1
------------
Release date: 2010-11-07


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ccache now falls back to preprocessor mode when a non-regular include file
  (device, socket, etc) has been detected so that potential hanging due to
  blocking reads is avoided.

- CRC errors are now detected when decompressing compressed files in the cache.

- Fixed potential object file corruption race on NFS.

- Minor documentation corrections.

- Fixed configure detection of ar.

- ccache development version (set by dev.mk) now works with gits whose
  `describe` command doesn't understand `--dirty`.


Other
~~~~~

- Minor debug log message improvements.


ccache 3.1
----------
Release date: 2010-09-16


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added support for hashing the output of a custom command (e.g. `%compiler%
  --version`) to identify the compiler instead of stat-ing or hashing the
  compiler binary. This can improve robustness when the compiler (as seen by
  ccache) actually isn't the real compiler but another compiler wrapper.

- Added support for caching compilations that use precompiled headers. (See the
  manual for important instructions regarding this.)

- Locking of the files containing statistics counters is now done using
  symlinks instead of POSIX locks. This should make ccache behave a lot better
  on file systems where POSIX locks are slow or broken (e.g. NFS on some
  systems).

- Manifest files are now updated without the need of taking locks.

- Updates of statistics counters are now always done in one of the sub-level
  statistics files. This reduces lock contention, which especially improves
  performance on slow NFS mounts.

- Reading and writing of statistics counters has been made forward-compatible
  (unknown counters are retained).

- Files are now read without using `mmap()`. This has two benefits: it's more
  robust against file changes during reading and it improves performance on
  poor systems where `mmap()` doesn't use the disk cache.

- Added `.cp` and `.CP` as known C++ suffixes.

- Improved logging.

- Added `-install_name` as an option known to take an argument. (This improves
  statistics when using the Darwin linker.)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Non-fatal error messages are now never printed to stderr but logged instead.

- Fixed a bug affecting failing commands when `--ccache-skip` is used.

- Made `--ccache-skip` work for all options.

- EINTR is now handled correctly.


Other
~~~~~

- Work on porting ccache to win32 (native), mostly done by Ramiro Polla. The
  port is not yet finished, but will hopefully be complete in some subsequent
  release.

- Added a `--nostats` flag to the performance benchmark program.

- Made the performance benchmark program more accurate when measuring cache
  hits.

- Added a new test framework for unit tests written in C.

- Got rid of `configure-dev`; dev mode is now given by `dev.mk.in` presence.

- Improved documentation on how to combine ccache with other compiler wrappers
  (like `distcc`).

- New `LICENSE.txt` file with licensing and copyright details about bundled
  source code.

- New `AUTHORS.txt` file with a list of ccache contributors.

- New `HACKING.txt` file with some notes about ccache code conventions.


ccache 3.0.1
------------
Release date: 2010-07-15


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The statistics counter ``called for link'' is now correctly updated when
  linking with a single object file.

- Fixed a problem with out-of-source builds.


ccache 3.0
----------
Release date: 2010-06-20


General
~~~~~~~

- ccache is now licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3
  or later.


Upgrade notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The way the hashes are calculated has changed, so you won't get cache hits
  for compilation results stored by older ccache versions. Because of this, you
  might as well clear the old cache directory with `ccache --clear` if you
  want, unless you plan to keep using an older ccache version.


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ccache now has a ``direct mode'' where it computes a hash of the source code
  (including all included files) and compiler options without running the
  preprocessor. By not running the preprocessor, CPU usage is reduced; the
  speed is somewhere between 1 and 5 times that of ccache running in
  traditional mode, depending on the circumstances. The speedup will be higher
  when I/O is fast (e.g., when files are in the disk cache). The direct mode
  can be disabled by setting +CCACHE_NODIRECT+.

- Support has been added for rewriting absolute paths to relative paths when
  hashing, in order to increase cache hit rate when building the same source
  code in different directories even when compiling with `-g` and when using
  absolute include directory paths. This is done by setting the
  `CCACHE_BASEDIR` environment variable to an absolute path that specifies
  which paths to rewrite.

- Object files are now optionally stored compressed in the cache. The runtime
  cost is negligible, and more files will fit in the ccache directory and in
  the disk cache. Set `CCACHE_COMPRESS` to enable object file compression. Note
  that you can't use compression in combination with the hard link feature.

- A `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK` option has been added. This option tells ccache what
  compiler-identifying information to hash to ensure that results retrieved
  from the cache are accurate. Possible values are: none (don't hash anything),
  mtime (hash the compiler's mtime and size) and content (hash the content of
  the compiler binary). The default is mtime.

- It is now possible to specify extra files whose contents should be included
  in the hash sum by setting the `CCACHE_EXTRAFILES` option.

- Added support for Objective-C and Objective-C\+\+. The statistics counter
  ``not a C/C++ file'' has been renamed to ``unsupported source language''.

- Added support for the `-x` compiler option.

- Added support for long command-line options.

- A `CACHEDIR.TAG` file is now created in the cache directory. See
  <http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/>.

- Messages printed to the debug log (specified by `CCACHE_LOGFILE`) have been
  improved.

- You can relax some checks that ccache does in direct mode by setting
  `CCACHE_SLOPPINESS`. See the manual for more information.

- `CCACHE_TEMPDIR` no longer needs to be on the same filesystem as
  `CCACHE_DIR`.

- The default value of `CCACHE_TEMPDIR` has been changed to `$CCACHE_DIR/tmp`
  to avoid cluttering the top directory.

- Temporary files that later will be moved into the cache are now created in
  the cache directory they will end up in. This makes ccache more friendly to
  Linux's directory layout.

- Improved the test suite and added tests for most of the new functionality.
  It's now also possible to specify a subset of tests to run.

- Standard error output from the compiler is now only stored in the cache if
  it's non-empty.

- If the compiler produces no object file or an empty object file, but gives a
  zero exit status (could be due to a file system problem, a buggy program
  specified by `CCACHE_PREFIX`, etc.), ccache copes with it properly.

- Added `installcheck` and `distcheck` make targets.

- Clarified cache size limit options' and cleanup semantics.

- Improved display of cache max size values.

- The following options are no longer hashed in the preprocessor mode:
  `-imacros`, `-imultilib`, `-iprefix`, `-iquote`, `-isysroot`, `-iwithprefix`,
  `-iwithprefixbefore`, `-nostdinc`, `-nostdinc++` and `-U`.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Various portability improvements.

- Improved detection of home directory.

- User-defined `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` are now respected in the Makefile.

- Fixed NFS issues.

- Computation of the hash sum has been improved to decrease the risk of hash
  collisions. For instance, the compiler options `-X -Y` and `-X-Y` previously
  contributed equally to the hash sum.

- Bail out on too hard compiler options `--coverage`, `-fprofile-arcs`,
  `-fprofile-generate`, `-fprofile-use`, `-frepo`, `-ftest-coverage` and
  `-save-temps`. Also bail out on `@file` style options.

- Errors when using multiple `-arch` compiler options are now noted as
  ``unsupported compiler option''.

- `-MD`/`-MMD` options without `-MT`/`-MF` are now handled correctly.

- The `-finput-charset` option is now handled correctly.

- Added support for `-Wp,-MD` and `-Wp,-MMD` options.

- The compiler options `-Xassembler`, `-b`, `-G` and `-V` are now correctly
  recognized as taking an argument.

- Debug information containing line numbers of predefined and command-line
  macros (enabled with the compiler option `-g3`) will now be correct.

- Corrected LRU cleanup handling of object files.

- `utimes()` is now used instead of `utime()` when available.

- Non-writable cache directories are now handled gracefully.

- Corrected documentation about sharing the cache directory.

- Fixed compilation warnings from GCC 4.3.

- The command specified by `CCACHE_PREFIX` is no longer part of the hash.

- Fixed bad memory access spotted by Valgrind.

- Fixed a bug in `x_realloc`.

- Freed memory is no longer referenced when compiling a `.i`/`.ii` file and
  falling back to running the real compiler.

- The test suite is now immune to external values of the `CCACHE_*` environment
  variables.

- Improved detection of recursive invocation.

- The ccache binary is now not unconditionally stripped when installing.

- Statistics counters are now correctly updated for -E option failures and
  internal errors.
