  // `min_age` specifies how old a file must be to be put in the cache. The
  // reason for this is that there is a race condition that consists of these
  // events:
  //
  // 1. A file is written with content C1, size S and timestamp (ctime/mtime) T.
  // 2. Ccache hashes the file content and asks the inode cache to store the
  //    digest with a hash of S and T (and some other data) as the key.
  // 3. The file is quickly thereafter written with content C2 without changing
  //    size S and timestamp T. The timestamp is not updated since the file
  //    writes are made within a time interval smaller than the granularity of
  //    the clock used for file system timestamps. At the time of writing, a
  //    common granularity on a Linux system is 0.004 s (250 Hz).
  // 4. The inode cache is asked for the file digest and the inode cache
  //    delivers a digest of C1 even though the file's content is C2.
  //
  // To avoid the race condition, the inode cache only caches inodes whose
  // timestamp was updated more than `min_age` ago. The default value is a
  // conservative 2 seconds since not all file systems have subsecond
  // resolution.
