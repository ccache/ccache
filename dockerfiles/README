This directory contains Dockerfiles for building and testing ccache in
different build environments.

For instance, run something like this to build ccache in Ubuntu 20.04:

    misc/build-in-docker ubuntu-20-focal

The above command will first build the Ubuntu 20.04 Docker image if needed and
finally build ccache and run the ccache test suite.

See also misc/test-all-systems.
