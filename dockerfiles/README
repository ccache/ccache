This directory contains Dockerfiles for building and testing ccache in
different build environments. They have all the requirements needed as per
doc/INSTALL.md.

For instance, run something like this to build ccache in Ubuntu:

    make docker BUILDENV=ubuntu

The above command will first build the Ubuntu Docker image if needed and
finally build ccache and run the ccache test suite.

You can also download prebuilt Docker images like this:

    docker pull ccache/build:$BUILDENV
